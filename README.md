# MoodTracker - AI Mood Detector
MoodTracker is a capstone project developed by Janine and Scarlet. After numerous iterations and debugging sessions, we are excited to successfully launch this iOS mobile application. The project aims to provide users with an iOS app to track their moods, observe mood fluctuations over the long term, identify patterns, and support their mental well-being. To make the mood logging process more engaging, we incorporated AI technology.

To ensure high accuracy and performance, we trained multiple machine learning models using various facial expression datasets. Ultimately, we selected the MobileViT v2 model, as it demonstrated the highest accuracy in our tests.

### MoodTracker enhances the mood logging experience through the following features:

- Engaging Logging Method: Users can simply upload a photo of their facial expression to complete a mood entry.

- AI Emotion Analysis: The built-in deep learning model automatically analyzes the emotion in the photo and logs it as a mood entry, enabling seamless emotional tracking.

- Long-Term Data Visualization: The app provides intuitive emotional trend charts, helping users review their mood changes and patterns over time.

The model consistently achieves a facial expression recognition accuracy of over 65%, which is comparable to human performance in complex emotional recognition tasks (approximately 65%).
